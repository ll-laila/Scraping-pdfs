Choice C is incorrect \nbecause the passage focuses on the narrator\u2019s desire to write rather \nthan on whatever skill he may have as a writer.

As described in the third paragraph, \nHodick and Sievers\u2019s model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes \nby means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant\u2019s hairs are \ntouched.

The second sentence of the last \nparagraph says that the focus of Volkov\u2019s work was the role of \nelectricity in the Venus flytrap\u2019s closing mechanism. The paragraph \ngoes on to explain that by applying electricity directly to the plant \nand \u201caltering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine \nthe exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.\u201d It is therefore \naccurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive \nuse of information obtained from measuring the plant\u2019s response to \nvarying amounts of electrical current.\nChoice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains \nthat Volkov\u2019s work was based on Hodick and Sievers\u2019s mathematical \nmodel in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus \nflytrap, that model isn\u2019t described as predicting the precise amount of \ncharge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier \nmodel, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use \nof the findings generated by his experiment.
