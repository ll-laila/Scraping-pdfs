(1, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In the passage, Lady Carlotta is \napproached by the “imposingly attired lady” Mrs. Quabarl while \nstanding at a train station (lines 32-35). Mrs. Quabarl assumes Lady \nCarlotta is her new nanny, Miss Hope: “You must be Miss Hope, the \ngoverness I’ve come to meet” (lines 36-37). Lady Carlotta does not \ncorrect Mrs. Quabarl’s mistake and replies, “Very well, if I must I must” \n(line 39). \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage is not about a \nwoman weighing a job choice, seeking revenge on an acquaintance, or \ndisliking her new employer.', 1),
(2, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. In lines 1-3, the narrator states that Lady \nCarlotta “stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station \nand took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length” in order \nto “kill time.” In this context, Lady Carlotta was taking a “turn,” or a \nshort walk, along the platform while waiting for the train to leave the \nstation. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because in this context “turn” does \nnot mean slight movement, change in rotation, or course correction. \nWhile Lady Carlotta may have had to rotate her body while moving \nacross the station, “took a turn” implies that Lady Carlotta took a short \nwalk along the platform’s length.', 2),
(3, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In lines 10-14, the narrator states that \nsome of Lady Carlotta’s acquaintances would often admonish, or \ncriticize, Lady Carlotta for meddling in or openly expressing her \n��������������������������������� \n© 2018 The College Board. College Board and SAT are registered trademarks of the College Board.', 3),
(4, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In lines 10-14, the narrator states that \npeople often criticized Lady Carlotta and suggested that she not \n����������������������������������������������������������������������� \nThe fact that people often were critical of Lady Carlotta’s behavior \nprovides evidence that Lady Carlotta was outspoken. \nChoices B, C, and D do not provide the best evidence that Lady \nCarlotta was outspoken. Choices B, C, and D mention Lady Carlotta, \nbut do not specify how others view her.', 4),
(5, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. Lines 4-10 establish that Lady Carlotta \nintervened on the part of a struggling horse, the kind of behavior for \nwhich, lines 10-14 indicate, she received “plentiful admonition” from \n“certain of her acquaintances,” who believed that she should mind her \nown business. Lines 14-22 indicate that Lady Carlotta had “only once . . . \nput the doctrine of non-interference into practice,” and that was when \n“one of its most eloquent exponents” had been “besieged for nearly \nthree hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an \nangry boar-pig” while Lady Carlotta blithely ignored the other woman’s \nhypocritical pleas for interference. This incident provides insight into \nLady Carlotta’s character and also evokes humor through language choice \n(e.g., the droll understatement of “it is to be feared that [Lady Carlotta] lost \nthe friendship of the ultimately rescued lady”; lines 22-23) and the sense \nthat, narratively speaking, justice has been served. \nChoice A is incorrect because nothing about the incident suggests \ndeception on Lady Carlotta’s part. Choice B is incorrect because \nthere is nothing subtle about Lady Carlotta leaving another woman \nstuck in a tree for nearly three hours. Moreover, the passage does not \nsuggest that this was an act of cruelty on Lady Carlotta’s part; rather, \n������������������������������������������������������������������� \nwoman stuck in a tree exactly what the woman had so often asked for: \nnoninterference. Choice D is incorrect because the passage indicates \nthat Lady Carlotta was acting consistently with her beliefs and only \ninvoked the doctrine to teach a hypocritical person a lesson.', 5),
(6, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The narrator explains that Mrs. Quabarl \ntold Lady Carlotta about the “nature of the charge” when she gave Lady \nCarlotta details about the Quabarl children (line 53-61). Since Lady \nCarlotta is pretending to be a governess, the term “charge” refers to her \nresponsibilities, or job duties, when caring for the Quabarl children.', 6),
(7, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. Lady Carlotta learns about Mrs. Quabarl’s \nchildren Claude, Wilfrid, and Irene (lines 53-58). The narrator then \ndescribes Mrs. Quabarl’s child Viola as “something or other else of a \nmould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in \nthe twentieth century” (lines 58-61). This statement about Viola implies \nthat all of the Quabarl children have skills typical, or “of a mould \nequally commonplace,” to other peers in their social class. \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not \nindicate that all of the Quabarl children are unusually creative and \nintelligent, hostile to the idea of having a governess, or more educated \nthan their peers.', 7),
(8, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 62-69, Mrs. Quabarl explains \nto Lady Carlotta that she wants her children to actively participate in \ntheir education, and that Lady Carlotta should not create lessons that \n��������������������������������������������������������������������� \nMrs. Quabarl emphasizes an education centered on active engagement \nwhen she states that her children should “not only be TAUGHT . . . but \nINTERESTED in what they learn.” \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not \nsuggest that Mrs. Quabarl favors an education that emphasizes \ntraditional values, artistic experimentation, or factual retention.', 8),
(9, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 77-82, the narrator describes \n�������������������������������������������������������������������� \ndomineering, but easily “cowed and apologetic” when someone \n������������������������������������ \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not \n�����������������������������������������������������������������', 9),
(10, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 77-82, the narrator provides \nevidence that Mrs. Quabarl appears imposing, or autocratic, but is \n����������������������������������������������������������������� \n���������������������������������������������������������������������� \nare not seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance \ngoes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic.”', 10),
(11, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. While the author predominantly \nsupports the use of public transportation, in the third paragraph he \nrecognizes some limitations to the public transportation system: it \nis a “depressing  experience” (lines 25-26) and “underfunded, ill-\nmaintained, and ill-planned” (line 31). \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because the third paragraph does \n������������������������������������������������������������� \nprovide an overview of a problem, or advocate ending the use of public \ntransportation.', 11),
(12, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The author notes that in North America \n“hopping in a car almost always gets you to your destination more \nquickly” (lines 32-34). This statement suggests that speed is one \nadvantage to driving in North America. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the author does not cite \nenvironmental impact, convenience, or cost as advantages of driving in \nNorth America.', 12),
(13, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 32-34, the author provides \nevidence that speed is one advantage to driving in North America, \nbecause driving “almost always gets you to your destination more \nquickly.” \nChoices A, B, and C do not provide the best evidence that speed is \none advantage to driving in North America. Choices A and B are \n������������������������������������������������������������������� \ntransportation. Choice C is incorrect because although these lines \nmention North America, they focus on the disadvantages of public \ntransportation.', 13),
(14, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. The author argues in the fourth \nparagraph that public transportation “can be faster, more comfortable, \nand cheaper than the private automobile” (lines 36-37) and provides \nexamples of fast and convenient public transportation systems. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because they focus on points made \nin the fourth paragraph rather than the paragraph’s central idea.', 14),
(15, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 35-37, the author provides \nevidence that some public transportation systems are superior \nto driving, because public transportation “can be faster, more \ncomfortable, and cheaper than the private automobile.” \nChoices A, C, and D do not provide the best evidence that some public \ntransportation systems are superior to driving, as they highlight points \nmade in the fourth paragraph rather than the paragraph’s central idea.', 15),
(16, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. In the last paragraph, the author explains \nthe trend that people who became adults around the end of the \ntwentieth century are more willing to use public transportation than \npeople from older generations. The author notes, “If you credit the \ndemographers, this transit trend has legs” (lines 58-59). In this context, \n“credit” means to believe the demographers’ claims about the trend. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because in this context, “credit” does \nnot mean endow, attribute, or honor.', 16),
(17, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 59-63, the author explains the \ntrend of people who became adults around the end of the twentieth \ncentury “tend[ing] to favor cities over suburbs.” In this context, these \nadults “favor,” or prefer, cities over suburbs. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because in this context “favor” does \nnot mean indulge, resemble, or serve.', 17),
(18, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 63-67, the author explains \nthat while riding on public transportation, people can use personal \nelectronic devices, such as “iPads, MP3 players, Kindles, and \nsmartphones.” \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not show that \npublic transportation is compatible with the use of personal electronic \ndevices.', 18),
(19, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. Figure 1 shows that 10.7% of \npublic transportation passengers are students and 6.7% of public \ntransportation passengers are retirees. Thus, more students than \nretirees use public transportation. \n�������������������������������������������������������������� \nemployed than unemployed people use public transportation and that \nmore employed people than homemakers use public transportation.', 19),
(20, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. Figure 1 shows that 72% of public \n����������������������������������������������������������������������� \nindicates that 59.1% of public transportation trips are for “work.” It \n������������������������������������������������������������������ \npassengers take public transportation to their place of employment. \n��������������������������������������������������������������������� \nindicate that public transportation passengers primarily use the system \nto run errands, use their own car on weekends, or are planning to \npurchase a car.', 20),
(21, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The author explains that Ken Dial \n������������������������������������������������������������������� \n������������������������������������������������������������������ \nthe unusual way Chukars use their “‘wings and legs cooperatively’” \nto scale hay bales (lines 38-43), and he created “a series of ingenious \nexperiments” (line 46) to study this observation. After his additional \nexperiments, Dial determined that these baby birds angle “their wings \n���������������������������������������������� \n������������������������������������������������������������������������ \nthe sequence of events in the passage.', 21),
(22, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In lines 6-9, the author explains that \nDial was “challenged,” or dared, by graduate students to develop “new \n��������������������������������������������������������������������� \ntheory). \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because in this context “challenged” \ndoes not mean required, disputed with, or competed with.', 22),
(23, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The author explains that Dial created his \ninitial experiment to try and create “new data on the age-old ground-\nup-tree-down debate,” and that he looked for “clues” in “how baby \n���������������������������������������������������������������������', 23),
(24, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 6-11, the author provides \nevidence that Dial’s central assumption in setting up his research is \n�������������������������������������������������������������������������� \n�������������������������������������������������������������������������� \nto “come up with new data on the age-old ground-up-tree-down \ndebate.” \nChoices A, C, and D do not provide the best evidence that Dial’s central \n����������������������������������������������������������������������� \n������������������������������������������������������������������������� \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because they focus on Dial’s \nexperiment and his observations on ground birds.', 24),
(25, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. When a rancher observed Dial’s \nlaboratory setup, he was “incredulous” that the Chukars were living on \nthe ground, and he advised Dial to give the birds “something to climb \non” (lines 16-23). This “key piece of advice” (line 14) led Dial to add \nhay bales to his laboratory. Dial later noticed that the Chukars were \nusing their legs and wings to scale the hay bales, and this observation \nbecame the focal point of his research. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the incident with the local \nrancher did not serve to reveal Dial’s motivation for creating the \n������������������������������������������������������������������ \n����������������������������������������������', 25),
(26, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The author explains that Dial’s “aha \nmoment” came when he determined the Chukars used “their legs \nand wings cooperatively” to scale the hay bales (lines 40-42). Dial \nthen created additional experiments to study how the birds dealt with \n������������������������������������������������������������������� \ntextured ramps tilted at increasing angles” (lines 46-48). \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because Dial’s “aha moment” was \n������������������������������������������������������������������ \n����������������������������������������������������������������� \nresearchers.', 26),
(27, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. Dial observed that as the Chukars raced \n������������������������������������������������������������������ \n��������������������������������������������������������������������� \nagainst the ramp” (lines 49-53). Dial determined that the position of \n������������������������������������������������������������������������ \nramps. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage does not \nindicate that the Chukars’ speed, alternation of wing and foot \nmovement, or continual hopping motions facilitated their traction on \nsteep ramps.', 27),
(28, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 61-63, the author explains that \n����������������������������������������������������������������� \nrunning, and went on to document it in a wide range of species.” In \nthis context, Dial “documented,” or recorded, the existence of WAIR in \nnumerous bird species. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, “document” \ndoes not mean to portray, publish, or process.', 28),
(29, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 70-74, the author explains that \n������������������������������������������������������������������� \nassisted incline running. Since Chukars, a ground bird, use WAIR to \nhelp scale steep inclines, it can be reasonably inferred that gliding \nanimals do not use WAIR to aid in climbing slopes. \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because the passage does not \n������������������������������������������������������������������ \nlocomotion, or their feeding habits.', 29),
(30, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 73-75, the author provides \n����������������������������������������������������������������������� \ndon’t do.” \nChoices A, B, and C do not provide the best evidence that gliding \n��������������������������������������������������������������������� \nchoices do not contain information about gliding animals.', 30),
(31, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 21-24, the authors of Passage 1 \nstate society’s “common happiness” is dependent on women never \nbecoming involved in politics. In this context, the authors of Passage 1 \nare suggesting that all members of society can have a “common,” or \nshared, happiness.', 31),
(32, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. In lines 25-30, the authors of Passage 1 \nstate that women should seek “gentle occupations and the cares of \n�������������������������������������������������������������������� \nunpleasant, or “onerous,” tasks. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors of Passage 1 \ndo not suggest that running a household and raising children are \nrewarding for both sexes, yield less value for society, or require \nprofessional or political skills.', 32),
(33, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. In lines 25-30, the authors of Passage 1 \nprovide evidence that women should run households and raise children \nbecause these roles do not require “strenuous habits and onerous \nduties.” \nChoices A, B, and D do not provide the best evidence that running \na household and raising children entail very few activities that are \n�������������������������������������������������������������������� \n���������������������������������������', 33),
(34, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 41-46, Wollstonecraft argues that \nif women do not receive an education “to become the companion of \nman,” or one that is comparable to men’s education, then society will \nnot progress in “knowledge and virtue.” \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because Wollstonecraft does not \nsuggest that society can progress only if women have happiness and \n���������������������������������������������������������������������� \npower.', 34),
(35, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. Wollstonecraft argues that women \nshould be granted an education comparable to men’s so that truth is \n“common to all” (lines 41-46). Wollstonecraft states that education \nwill “strengthen [women’s] reason till she comprehend her duty” \n(lines 49-50). In this context, Wollstonecraft is arguing that education \nwill improve women’s “reason,” or intellect, and allow women to \nconsider their role in society. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because in this context “reason” \ndoes not mean motive, sanity, or explanation.', 35),
(36, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In lines 72-78, Wollstonecraft argues that \nthe laws passed by society’s leaders allow men to “contend for their \nfreedom” but serve to “subjugate women.” In this context, “subjugate” \nmeans to control. Wollstonecraft is arguing that society’s leaders grant \nmen freedoms that are denied to women. \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because Wollstonecraft does not \nclaim that society’s leaders have granted freedoms that created a \ngeneral reduction in individual virtue, caused arguments about \nhappiness, or ensured equality for all people.', 36),
(37, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 72-75, Wollstonecraft provides \nevidence that society’s leaders grant freedoms that privilege men. \nShe argues that while society’s leaders believe they “are acting in \nthe manner best calculated to promote [women’s] happiness,” their \ndecisions don’t allow women to “contend for their freedom.” \nChoices A, B, and C do not provide the best evidence that society’s \nleaders grant freedoms that privilege men over women.', 37),
(38, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. Wollstonecraft cites the statement made \nby the authors of Passage 1 that excluding women from political \nparticipation is “according to abstract principles . . . impossible to \nexplain” (lines 61-65). Wollstonecraft then states that if the authors of \nPassage 1 can discuss “the abstract rights of man” they should be able \nto discuss the abstract rights of women (lines 66-69). In these lines, \n����������������������������������������������������������������������� \nreasoning presented by the authors of Passage 1. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because Wollstonecraft does not refer \nto the statement made in Passage 1 to call into question the authors’ \n���������������������������������������������������������������������� \nown government (sentence one of Passage 1), or validate the authors’ \nconclusions on gender roles.', 38),
(39, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The authors of Passage 1 argue that \nwhile restricting women’s freedoms may be “impossible to explain” \n(line 7), this restriction is necessary for society’s overall happiness \n(lines 13-17). Wollstonecraft, however, strongly challenges this \nargument, asking the authors of Passage 1, “Who made man the \nexclusive judge” of which freedoms are granted to women, and likening \nsociety’s male leaders to tyrants as they deny women their “civil and \npolitical rights” and leave them “groping in the dark” (lines 78-88). \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not characterize the \noverall relationship between Passage 1 and Passage 2.', 39),
(40, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The authors of Passage 1 admit that \nwomen are “excluded by the other half [men] from any participation in \ngovernment” (lines 1-2), and Wollstonecraft states that society’s male \nleaders create laws that deny women “civil and political rights” (line 86). \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because the authors of both \npassages would not agree that women had the same preferences as \nmen, required a good education, or were as happy as men.', 40),
(41, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer.����������������������������������� \nparagraph of Passage 2 that society’s male leaders are like “tyrants” \nthat deny women “civil and political rights” (lines 81-88). The authors \nof Passage 1 would most likely argue that allowing women these \nrights would be “a reversal of [society’s] primary destinies” as society’s \nleaders should only seek women’s interests as they pertain to the \n“wishes of nature,” such as women’s role as mothers (lines 18-30). \nThe authors of Passage 1 clarify that “nature” created two sexes for a \nparticular reason, so while men can exercise civil and political rights, \nwomen are not naturally suited to these activities (lines 30-36). \nChoices B and C are incorrect because they are not supported by \ninformation in Passage 1. Choice D is incorrect because the authors of \nPassage 1 do not mention “natural law,” only the “wishes of nature.”', 41),

When discussing problems with bee \ncolonies, the authors use phrases like “we suspect” (line 19) and “we \n�������������������������������������������������������������������� \ncolonies’ susceptibility to mite infestations. The use of “can,” “may,” \nand “could” creates a tentative tone and provides further evidence that \nthe authors believe, but are not certain, that their hypothesis is correct. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors’ use of “can,” \n“may,” and “could” does not create an optimistic, dubious, or critical \ntone.', 42),
(43, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. In lines 24-28, the authors hypothesize \nthat bee colonies will be susceptible to mite infestations if they do not \noccasionally feed on pyrethrum producing plants. In lines 42-46, they \nsuggest creating a trial where a “small number of commercial honey \n������������������������������������������������������������������� \ntest their hypothesis.', 43),
(44, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 24-28, the authors provide \nevidence that a bee colony may be more resistant to mite infections \nif the bees eat pyrethrums because this diet may help prevent bees \n���������������������������������������������������������������� \nlines 42-50, the authors suggest testing this hypothesis in a trial on \nhoneybees. \nChoices A, B, and C do not describe any of the authors’ hypotheses.', 44),

The authors explain that when \n���������������������������������������������������������� \nmite infections, they may “further weaken” bees that are \n������������������������������������������������������������ \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because the authors do not suggest \nthat beekeepers’ use of commercially produced insecticides increases \nmite populations, kills bacteria, or destroys bees’ primary food source.', 45),
(46, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. In lines 31-35, the authors provide \nevidence that beekeepers’ use of commercially produced insecticides \nmay cause further harm to “immunocompromised or nutritionally \n��������������� \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not provide the best \nevidence that beekeepers’ use of commercially produced insecticides \nmay be harmful to bees; choices A, B, and D focus on mite infestations’ \nimpact on honeybees.', 46),
(47, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 31-35, the authors argue that \nbeekeepers’ use of insecticides to control mite infestations may be \nharmful to some bees. The authors then state, “We further postulate \nthat the proper dosage necessary to prevent mite infestation may \nbe better left to the bees” (lines 35-37). In this context, the authors \n“postulate,” or put forth the idea that the bees may naturally control \nmite infestations better than insecticides. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, “postulate” \ndoes not mean to make an unfounded assumption, question a belief or \n������������������������������������������', 47),
(48, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph the authors \npropose a trial to study if honeybees’ consumption of pyrethrum \nproducing plants helps the honeybees defend against mite infestations. \n��������������������������������������������������������������� \nboth pyrethrum producing plants and “a typical bee food source \n��������������������������������������������������������������������� \nsusceptibility to mite infestations. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the main purpose of the \nfourth paragraph is not to summarize the results of an experiment, \nprovide a comparative nutritional analysis, or predict an outcome of an \n���������������������', 48),
(49, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In lines 43-45, the authors propose a \n��������������������������������������������������������������������� \nproducing plants, as well as a typical bee food source such as clover.” \nSince the authors contrast the “pyrethrum producing plants” with \nclover, a “typical bee food source,” it can be assumed that clover does \nnot produce pyrethrums. \nChoice B is incorrect because it is stated in the passage. Choices C \nand D are incorrect because they are not assumptions made by the \nauthors.', 49),
(50, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. The table shows that 77 percent of the \nhoneybee colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all \nfour pathogens. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not identify the \npercent of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder that were \ninfected by all four pathogens as based on data in the table.', 50),
(51, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of \n�������������������������������������������������������������� \npathogen ��������������. \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the \npathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies \nwithout colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.', 51),
(52, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The table discusses pathogen occurrence \nin honeybee colonies, but it includes no information as to whether \nthese honeybees were infected with mites. Because the table does not', 52),
(53, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The passage begins with the main character, Lymie, sitting in a restaurant \nand reading a history book. The first paragraph describes the book in front of him (“Blank pages front \nand back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body,” lines 11-\n13). The second paragraph reveals what Lymie is reading about (the Peace of Paris and the Congress of \nVienna) and suggests his intense concentration on the book (“sometimes he swallowed whole the food \nthat he had no idea he was eating,” lines 23-24). In the third paragraph, the focus of the passage shifts \nto a description and discussion of others in the restaurant, namely “A party of four, two men and two \nwomen . . . ” (lines 42-43). \nChoice A is incorrect because the passage does not provide observations made by other characters, only \noffering Lymie’s and the narrator’s observations. Choice B is incorrect because the beginning of the \npassage focuses on Lymie as he reads by himself and the end of the passage focuses on the arrival of \nLymie’s father, with whom Lymie’s relationship seems somewhat strained. Choice C is incorrect because \nthe setting is described in the beginning of the first paragraph but is never the main focus of the \npassage.', 53),
(54, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The main purpose of the first paragraph is to establish the passage’s setting \nby describing a place and an object. The place is the Alcazar Restaurant, which is described as being \n“long and narrow” and decorated with “art moderne,” murals, and plants (lines 2-6), and the object is \nthe history book Lymie is reading. \nChoice A is incorrect because rather than establishing what Lymie does every night, the first paragraph \ndescribes what Lymie is doing on one night. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the first paragraph \nindicates when the passage takes place, as the details provided (such as the restaurant and the book) \nare not specific to one era. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the first paragraph clearly \nforeshadows a later event.', 54),

(56, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The passage makes it clear that Lymie finds the party of four who enter the \nrestaurant to be loud and bothersome, as their entrance means he is no longer able to concentrate on \nhis book: “They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for . . . and their laughter was too loud. \nBut it was the women’s voices . . . which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing \nwhat was on them” (lines 52-59). \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because lines 55-59 make clear that Lymie is annoyed by the party of \nfour, not that he finds their presence refreshing (choice B), thinks they resemble the people he is \nreading about (choice C), or thinks they represent glamour and youth (choice D).', 56),
(57, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The previous question asks about Lymie’s impression of the party of four \nwho enter the restaurant, with the correct answer being that he finds them noisy and distracting. This is \nsupported in lines 55-59: “But it was the women’s voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the \nwomen’s voices, which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on \nthem.” \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous', 57),
(58, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In the passage, Lymie closes his book only after “a coat that he recognized \nas his father’s was hung on the hook next to his chair” (lines 67-68). It is Lymie’s father’s arrival that \ncauses him to close the book.', 58),
(59, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 74-79, the narrator describes Mr. Peters as “gray” and balding, \nnoting that he has “lost weight” and his color is “poor.” This description suggests Mr. Peters is aging and \nlosing strength and vigor. \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because the description of Mr. Peters in lines 74-79 suggests he is a \nperson who is wan and losing vitality, not someone who is healthy and in good shape (choice A), angry \nand intimidating (choice B), or emotionally anxious (choice C).', 59),
(60, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In the last paragraph of the passage, Mr. Peters is described as being \nunaware “that there had been any change” in his appearance since he was younger (lines 80-81). Later \nin the paragraph, the passage states that “the young man” Mr. Peters once was “had never for one \nsecond deserted” him (lines 90-91). The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters still thinks of \nhimself as young, or at least acts as if he is a younger version of himself. \nChoice A is incorrect because Mr. Peters is spending time with Lymie, his son, and there is no indication \nthat he generally does not spend time with his family. Choice C is incorrect because although there are \nbrief mentions of a diamond ring and manicured fingers, the paragraph focuses on Mr. Peters’s overall \nappearance, not on his awareness of status symbols. Choice D is incorrect because the last paragraph \nclearly states that Mr. Peters is “not aware that there had been any change” and thinks of himself as \nyoung.', 60),
(61, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In lines 81-85, Mr. Peters is described as having “straightened his tie self-\nconsciously” and gestured with a menu “so that the two women at the next table would notice the \ndiamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand.” Mr. Peters’s actions are those of someone who \nwants to attract attention and be noticed. \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the idea Mr. Peters wants to \nattract attention to himself. Choices A and C address Mr. Peters’s view of himself.

(63, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beecher makes the point that even if women in her society \nare perceived as being inferior to men, they are still able to effect considerable influence on that society: \n“But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was \ndesigned that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading” (lines 6-10). \nChoice A is incorrect because Beecher describes the dynamic between men and women in terms of the \nway they can change society, not in terms of security and physical safety. Choice C is incorrect because \neven though Beecher implies that women have fewer rights in society than men do, she doesn’t say that \nwomen have fewer responsibilities. Choice D is incorrect because Beecher does not assert that women \nare superior to men.', 63),
(64, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The previous question asks what point Beecher makes regarding the \nrelationship between men and women in her society, with the answer being that women are considered \ninferior but can still have influence. This is supported in lines 6-10: “But while woman holds a \nsubordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her \ninfluence should be any the less important, or all-pervading.” \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous', 64),
(65, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In the third paragraph (lines 22-37), Beecher suggests that women can be \n“so much respected, esteemed and loved” by those around them that men will accede to their wishes: \n“then, the fathers, the husbands, and the sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they \nwill yield not only willingly but proudly . . . .” These lines show that Beecher believes women can \ninfluence society by influencing the men around them; in other words, women have an indirect \ninfluence on public life.', 65),
(66, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. Regarding the dynamic of men and women in society, Beecher says that \none sex is given “the subordinate station” while the other is given the “superior” station (lines 1-2). In \nthe context of how one gender exists in comparison to the other, the word “station” suggests a standing \nor rank. \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because in the context of the relative standing of men and women in \nBeecher’s society, the word “station” suggests a standing or rank, not a physical location or area \n(choices A, B, and C).', 66),
(67, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. When describing how men and women can influence society, Beecher says \nthe ways they can do so “should be altogether different and peculiar” (lines 11-12). In the context of the \n“altogether different” ways men and women can influence society, the word “peculiar” implies being \nunique or distinctive. \nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because in the context of the “altogether different” ways men and \nwomen can influence society, the word “peculiar” suggests something unique or distinctive, not \nsomething unusual and odd (choice A), unexpected (choice B), or rare (choice D).', 67),
(68, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because \nthey are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that \n“human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral \nnature” and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, “Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral \nbeing, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to \nwoman.” \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women \ninherently have the same rights (“rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,” lines 65-66). Her \ncentral claim is not that men and women need to work together to change society (choice B), that moral \nrights are the distinguishing characteristic separating humans from animals (choice C), or that there \nshould be equal opportunities for men and women to advance and succeed.', 68),
(69, 'B', '', 69),
(70, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks what point Grimké makes about human rights \nin Passage 2, with the answer being that they exist and have moral authority whether or not they are \nestablished by societal law. This is supported in lines 61-65: “These rights may be wrested from the \nslave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: it \nis stamped on his moral being, and is, like it, imperishable.” \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous', 70),
(71, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have different \npositions in society: “Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate \nstation” (lines 1-2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to \ninfluence men but should not “exert coercive influences” that would put her “out of her appropriate \nsphere” (lines 44-46). In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different \nrights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states \nthat “the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to \nwoman” (lines 66-68). \nChoice A is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is \nproposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1. Choice C is incorrect \nbecause Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages \nwere published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society. Choice D is incorrect \nbecause Passage 2 does not elaborate on implications found in Passage 1 as much as it disputes the \nideas explicitly expressed in Passage 1.', 71),
(72, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman’s role in \nsociety, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and \nresponsibilities in society. In Passage 1, Beecher writes that “while woman holds a subordinate relation \nin society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be \nany the less important, or all-pervading” (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to \nuse their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all \npeople “are moral beings” (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have “rights and responsibilities” \n(line 68). She concludes that “whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to \ndo” (lines 81-83). \nChoice B is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political \nchanges, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. \nChoice C is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women’s ethical obligations, \nalthough both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations. Choice D is incorrect \nbecause in Passage 1 Beecher argues that women should avoid direct political activism, cautioning \nagainst actions that would put them outside their “appropriate sphere” (line 46).', 72),
(73, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 65-68 of Passage 2, Grimké writes, “Now if rights are founded in \nthe nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and \nresponsibilities, than to woman.” In other words, gender does not make men’s rights and duties \nsuperior to women’s. Beecher, on the other hand, begins Passage 1 by stating that “heaven has \nappointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station,” suggesting that men and \nwomen have fundamentally different natures. Therefore, Beecher most likely would have disagreed \nwith Grimké’s assertion. \nChoices A and B are incorrect because Beecher fundamentally disagrees with Grimké regarding the basic \nnature and societal roles of men and women, making it very unlikely that she would have viewed \nGrimké’s statement in lines 65-68 with either sympathy or agreement. Choice C is incorrect because \nBeecher wouldn’t necessarily have been dismayed by Grimké’s belief as much as she would have simply \ndisagreed with it, and she does not indicate that the role of women in society is more difficult to play \nthan is that of men.', 73),
(74, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. In line 14, the passage states that industrial agriculture has become \n“incredibly efficient on a simple land to food basis.” In this context, “simple” suggests something basic \nor straightforward.', 74),
(75, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. The passage clearly states that conventional agriculture is very efficient, \nespecially when compared to organic farming: “organic farming yields 25% fewer crops on average than \nconventional agriculture” (lines 40-42) and in a study “organic farming delivered a lower yield for every \ncrop type” (lines 51-52). It can therefore be understood from the passage that conventional agriculture \ndoes a good job maximizing the output of the land that is farmed. \nChoice A is incorrect because the passage states how efficient conventional agriculture is in regard to \nthe amount of food it can produce but does not indicate that it produces a significantly wide variety of \nfruits and vegetables. Choice C is incorrect because even if the passage does say that each American \nfarmer can produce crops to feed “over 155 people worldwide” (lines 16-17), it never claims that \nconventional agriculture can satisfactorily feed everyone in the world. Choice D is incorrect because the \npassage states that conventional agriculture uses a great deal of nitrogen, not that it changes the need \nfor nitrogen in plant growth one way or the other.', 75),
(76, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The passage makes it clear that “most environmentalists” (line 27) believe \nconventional agriculture produces food that is not as healthy as food produced through organic farming \nand that it is more harmful to the environment than organic farming is: many environmentalists “have \nembraced organic food as better for the planet—and healthier and tastier, too—than the stuff produced \nby agricultural corporations” (lines 28-31). \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not supported by the passage. The passage never \nstates that many environmentalists believe that conventional farming reduces the need to convert \nwilderness to farmland (choice B), is in any way good for the environment (choice C), or protects wildlife \nhabitats (choice D).', 76),
(77, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. The previous question asks how environmentalists perceive conventional \nagriculture, with the answer being that they believe it produces a product that is less healthy and more \nenvironmentally destructive than that produced by organic farming. This is supported in lines 28-31: \n“They have embraced organic food as better for the planet—and healthier and tastier, too—than the \nstuff produced by agricultural corporations.” \nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous', 77),
(78, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The passage makes it clear that while both conventional and organic \nfarming need nitrogen for plant growth, conventional farming uses synthetic fertilizers and organic does \nnot: “Conventional agriculture makes use of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each year, and \nall that nitrogen enables much faster plant growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the compost \nor cover crops used in organic farming” (lines 61-65). \nChoice A is incorrect because the passage does not state that conventional and organic farming are \nequally sustainable and does state that organic farming needs “more land” to produce “fewer crops” \n(lines 42-43) but does not indicate that it always requires dramatically more land. Choice B is incorrect \nbecause the passage does not state that organic farming uses artificial chemicals. Choice D is incorrect \nbecause the passage mentions nitrogen runoff only as a product of conventional farming, not organic \nfarming, and does not indicate that only the nitrogen in conventional fertilizers is dangerous.', 78),
(79, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The previous question asks about the relationship between conventional \nagriculture and organic farming, with the answer being that unlike organic farms, conventional farms \nuse synthetic fertilizers. This is supported in lines 61-65: “Conventional agriculture makes use of 171 \nmillion metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster plant \ngrowth than the slower release of nitrogen from the compost or cover crops used in organic farming.”  \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous', 79),
(80, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. The passage states that the authors of the study comparing conventional \nand organic farming have come to the conclusion that an “ideal global agriculture system” would \n“borrow the best from both systems” (lines 80-82). The quote from Jonathan Foley in lines 84-97 \nindicates that this ideal system would take into consideration many different factors, including the \nnutrition and calories offered by specific types of foods as well as different geographic, economic, and \nsocial needs.  \nChoices A and D are incorrect because the passage makes it clear that the “ideal global agriculture \nsystem” would give consideration to multiple factors, not that it would focus mainly on productivity', 80),
(81, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The passage states that conventional agriculture can be superior to organic \nfarming in terms of producing “sheer calories” (line 88). In this context, “sheer” most nearly means pure; \nthe passage is referring to the pure number of calories delivered by foods. \nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because in the context of discussing the calories foods can provide, \n“sheer” suggests the pure number of calories. Also, it does not make sense to say that calories can be \nseen through (choice A), are somehow sudden or happen unexpectedly (choice B), or are at a very sharp \nangle (choice C).', 81);

(85, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The author of the passage suggests that a group of people can be “wiser” \nand more effective than a single person at assessing a quantitative answer, or a measurement, versus \nproducing a valid qualitative judgment, or a judgment of the quality of something.

In the first paragraph the reader is introduced to Nawab, a father of twelve \ndaughters who feels compelled to make more money to care for his family: “he must proliferate his \nsources of revenue” (lines 6-7). The remainder of the paragraph focuses on the way Nawab attempts to \n“proliferate” those income sources by identifying some of the moneymaking schemes Nawab \nundertakes, including setting up a flour mill and a fish farm and attempting to fix both radios and \nwatches.  \nChoice A is incorrect because even if the first paragraph does indicate that Nawab is willing to work hard \nto take care of his family, it does not specifically address how he interacts with his daughters \nemotionally. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph describes some of Nawab’s activities but \nnot the specifics of his schedule.

(106, 'B', 'Choice B is the best answer. The passage states that Nawab earned “more kicks than kudos” (line 16) \nfor his failed attempts at fixing watches. In the context of not doing a job well, this means Nawab was \nnot given compliments (“kudos”) for his efforts but complaints (“kicks”) about them. \nChoices A and D are incorrect because the passage clearly states that Nawab was not successful fixing \nwatches, which earned him a negative response (“kicks,” or complaints). In this context it would be \nillogical to suggest that Nawab’s unsuccessful efforts at fixing watches would result in the sort of \npositive response implied by choice A (“thrills”) or choice D (“interests”).

(120, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The passage explains that although the major news organizations were \nonce considered “trusted shapers” (line 29) of public knowledge, that perception is changing due to the \n“growing feeling . . . that the news media should be ‘informative rather than authoritative’; the job of \njournalists should be to ‘give the news as raw as it is, without putting their slant on it’; and people \nshould be given ‘sufficient information’ from which ‘we would be able to form opinions of our own’” \n(lines 70-77). In other words, the audience now wants raw facts about the world, not facts constructed \nin support of a certain opinion. \nChoice B is incorrect because the passage presents the public as wanting information without any slant \non it, not as wanting only a limited amount of information.

The remainder of the \npassage focuses on describing the purpose, process, and results of the recent research done on those \nTexas gourd vines. \nChoice A is incorrect because the passage doesn’t focus on the assumptions behind a theory but rather \non the way in which that theory was tested. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not present \nmuch conflicting data; most of it supports the idea there can be too much fragrance for the Texas gourd \nvine.

Because they gathered data by looking at and \nstudying the plants in question, the scientists’ research is best characterized as relying on direct \nobservation. \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because lines 62-63 make clear that the research emphasized direct \nobservation, not historical data (choice B), expert testimony (choice C), or random sampling (choice D).', 127),
(128, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. The passage states that by using the smell of their nectar to lure pollinators \nlike bees, Texas gourd vines are employing an “’open communication network’” that attracts “’not just \nthe good guys, but . . . also . . . the bad guys’” (lines 7-10). Because cucumber beetles are then identified \nas some of “the very bad guys” (line 12) as far as the Texas gourd plant is concerned, it can be inferred \nthat both the beetles and the bees are attracted to the same scent.', 128),
(129, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The author indicates that it is reasonable to think that the Texas gourd \nplants might lure more pollinators if their smell was stronger. This is clear from lines 26-27, which state \nthat “intuition suggests that more of that aroma should be even more appealing to bees.” \nChoices A and D are incorrect because lines 26-27 support the idea that it was initially thought that \nTexas gourd vines could lure more pollinators through “more of that aroma,” not by lacking an aroma \n(choice A) or giving off a more varied aroma (choice D). Choice B is incorrect because bees are the only \npollinators specifically discussed in the passage, and there is no suggestion that targeting other insects \nwould attract more bees.', 129),

The passage explains that as part of their research the scientists “made half \nthe plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers. Each \ntreated flower emitted about 45 times more fragrance than a normal one” (lines 35-39). In this context, \na flower that was “treated” would be one that was changed or altered. \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of a flower having a compound like \ndimethoxybenzene added to it, the word “treated” means changed or altered, not returned to normal \n(choice B), given (choice C), or kept for future use (choice D).', 130),

In the passage Theis surmises that honey bees were likely repelled not by \nthe enhanced fragrance of the dimethoxybenzene-treated flowers but “by the abundance of beetles” \n(lines 71-72) found on them. She was able to make that assumption because the honey bees were able \nto choose between both normal flowers and fragrance-enhanced flowers without any beetles on them, \nbecause one of the parameters of the research was that “every half hour throughout the experiments, \nthe team plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, \nallowing bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles” (lines 45-50). \nChoice A is incorrect because the passage states only that the scientists observed the bees and beetles \non the flowers as soon as they opened (lines 59-61), not both before and after they opened.

The previous question asks what Theis and Adler did to allow Theis to \ntheorize that the bees were repelled not by the enhanced fragrance of certain flowers but by the \nexcessive number of beetles on them, with the answer (they give the bees the chance to visit both \nnormal and fragrance-enhanced flowers that did not have beetles on them) being supported in lines 45-\n50: “So every half hour throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the beetles off of half the \nfragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to the blossoms with \nand without interference by beetles.” \nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous', 132),
(133, 'A', 'Choice A is the best answer. The first six paragraphs (lines 1-64) of the passage introduce a plant (the \nTexas gourd vine) and its problem (luring enough insects to pollinate it but not too many of those that \nwill harm it) and then describe a study undertaken to deal with “the specific problem of the Texas \ngourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles” (lines 18-20). After the specifics of \nthat experiment are described in detail, the results are explained and summarized in the seventh and \neighth paragraphs (lines 65-84): “What they saw was double the normal number of beetles. . . . Squash \nbees were indifferent, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often. . . . That added up to less \nreproduction for fragrance-enhanced flowers” (lines 65-76).  \nChoice B is incorrect because Theis and Adler’s hypothesis (that more fragrance would make the flowers \n“even more appealing to bees,” line 27) is found in the third paragraph (lines 26-40). Choice C is \nincorrect because Theis and Adler’s methods are described in the third through sixth paragraphs (lines \n26-64), not the seventh and eighth (lines 65-84).

Theis and Adler’s research clearly provided an answer to the question of \nwhy there is an upper limit on the intensity of the aroma emitted by Texas gourd plants, as their \nexperiment was described as being able to “provide a reason that Texas gourd plants never evolved to \nproduce a stronger scent” (lines 85-86). \nChoice A is incorrect because Theis and Adler’s research was not able to show how to increase pollinator \nvisits to the Texas gourd vine, as the results of their experiment showed that “pollinators, to their \nsurprise, did not prefer the highly scented flowers” (lines 67-68). Choice C is incorrect because Theis and \nAdler’s research was not able to explain how hand pollination rescued fruit weight, a finding the passage \ndescribes as “a hard-to-interpret result” (line 83). Choice D is incorrect because the passage never \nindicates that the flowers stop producing fragrance when beetles are present.', 135),

In Passage 1, Lincoln asserts that citizens of the United States should never \nbreak the laws of their land, for any reason, because to do so undermines the nation’s values.

(139, 'D', 'Choice D is the best answer. In lines 24-25, Lincoln says, “I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all \nthe laws.” In this context, the word “urge” most nearly means advocate, because when Lincoln urges \npeople to obey the laws, he is pleading in favor of them doing so. \nChoices A and C are incorrect because in the context of lines 24-25 (“I so pressingly urge a strict \nobservance of all the laws”), to urge that laws be followed is to advocate for them to be obeyed, not to \nspeed up such adherence (choice A) or make such adherence necessary (choice C).

His philosophy regarding how to deal with those unjust laws is evident in lines 58-59: “If the \ninjustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government, let it go, let it go.” Thoreau \nbelieves, in other words, that some injustices are an unfortunate part of normal governance and just \nneed to be endured (“let it go, let it go”). \nChoice A is incorrect because Thoreau does not say some unjust aspects of government can be fixed \neasily or that they are merely superficial. Choice B is incorrect because Thoreau does not argue that \nsuch injustices are subtle and should be studied, but rather that in certain cases it is best to “let it go, let \nit go” (line 59), while in other cases one should act or “break the law” (line 66).

In Passage 1, Lincoln makes clear his belief that individuals should always \nheed the laws: “Let every American . . . swear . . . never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the \ncountry” (lines 1-4). Even bad laws, he states, “while they continue in force, for the sake of example, \nthey should be religiously observed” (lines 30-32). In Passage 2, Thoreau is less rigid in his beliefs \nregarding the need for individuals to heed the laws of the country, arguing at times that some laws \nshould be broken: “but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, \nthen, I say, break the law” (lines 64-66). While Lincoln and Thoreau can therefore be said to disagree \nabout the moral imperative to follow existing laws, both passages advance an opinion regarding the \nneed to follow or not follow all of the country’s laws. \nChoice A is incorrect because the passages are not making arguments about differences between legal \nduties and moral imperatives but rather are addressing the need to follow (or not) the laws of a land. \nChoice B is incorrect. Both passages address the question of changing existing laws in the United States, \nbut that is only a minor part of what is a greater debate about the need to follow or not follow existing \nlaws.

In Passage 2, Thoreau says that if a law “is of such a nature that it requires \nyou to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law” (lines 64-66). It is clear from \nPassage 1 that Lincoln would reject this stance, as he says individuals should never break the law (“Let \nevery American . . . swear . . . never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country,” lines 1-4) \nand should wait for a bad law to be repealed (“bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed . . . still while \nthey continue . . . they should be religiously observed,” lines 29-32). \nChoices A and C are incorrect because in Passage 1, Lincoln is absolutely clear that all laws “should be \nreligiously observed” (line 32); he does not describe anyone’s suggestion to break the law as either \nexcusable (choice A) or honorable (choice C).

In Passage 2, Thoreau does the \nsame thing by noting that “those who call themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw \ntheir support . . . from the government” (lines 79-82). Although Lincoln and Thoreau use the cause of \nabolitionism to argue different points, a commonality they share is that neither embraces the cause \npersonally in the passage; Lincoln simply uses it as an example (“as for instance”) while Thoreau \nspecifically talks of other people “who call themselves Abolitionists.”', 146),

With these experiences also \ncome “crowding remembrances” of his early life — the life he led before \namassing his hoard of gold. In its entirety, the paragraph can therefore \nbe seen as illustrating the profound change into a more sociable being \nthat Silas has undergone as a result of parenting Eppie.\nChoice A is incorrect because the second paragraph does not present \na particular moment when Silas realizes that Eppie has changed him \nbut instead describes a pattern of behavior indicative of that change. \nChoice B is incorrect because the second paragraph shows the benefits \nSilas derives from Eppie’s presence, rather than any sacrifices he has \nmade for her.

In the fourth paragraph, Brynjolfsson \nasserts, “Productivity is at record levels, innovation has never been \nfaster, and yet at the same time, we have a falling median income and \nwe have fewer jobs.” In order to evaluate his statement that today “we \nhave fewer jobs,” figure 2 would need to include accurate information \nabout the number of jobs held by people employed in factories from \n1960 to 2011. Without knowing those numbers, it’s not possible to \ndetermine whether Brynjolfsson’s statement is correct.\nChoice A is incorrect because a comparison of the median income of \nall three nations’ factory workers within a single year would not aid \nin the evaluation of Brynjolfsson’s statement regarding changes in \nworker productivity over a span of 10 to 15 years. Choices C and D \nare incorrect because knowing either the types of organizations where \nthose outputs were measured or which specific manufacturing jobs \nmight have been lost to new technologies would not be helpful in \nevaluating Brynjolfsson’s statement about how median incomes have \nfallen and job growth has reduced over time.', 177),
(178, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. The main purpose of the passage is \nconveyed by the first sentence: “Anyone watching the autumn sky \nknows that migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists have \nlong debated why.” The first paragraph continues by focusing on \nnew research that might answer the question of why birds fly in that \nformation (“presumably to catch the preceding bird’s updraft — and \nsave energy during flight”). As a whole, the passage can therefore be \nseen as a discussion of the biological motivation behind migrating \nbirds’ reliance on the V formation.\nChoice A is incorrect because the squadrons of planes mentioned in \nthe second paragraph are used as an example to discuss migrating \nbirds but are not themselves the main subject of this passage. \nChoice B is incorrect because although the fourth paragraph does \ndiscuss the role of downdrafts in V-formation flight, this discussion \nis brief and does not constitute a main purpose. Choice D is incorrect \nbecause the passage does not illustrate how birds sense air currents \nthrough their feathers; instead, the seventh paragraph suggests in \npassing that such sensation may play a role in maintaining the V \nformation: “Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic \nsweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either \nby sight or by sensing air currents through their feathers.”', 178),

The reason Usherwood used northern bald \nibises as the subjects of his study is clearly stated at the beginning of \nthe third paragraph: “The study, published in Nature, took advantage \nof an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises \n(Geronticus eremita) to Europe.” Because the project reintroducing \nthose birds was already underway, it was therefore easy for Usherwood \nand his team to join it.\nChoice A is incorrect because it would not be accurate to say that \nibises were well acquainted with their migration route, as the third \nparagraph explains that scientists needed to “show hand-raised birds \ntheir ancestral migration route.” Choice B is incorrect because the third \nparagraph states that the ibises wore “data loggers specially built by \nUsherwood and his lab” but never indicates that they had worn any \nsuch device before or undertaken migration previously. Choice C is \nincorrect because the passage never claims that ibises’ body shape is \nsimilar to the design of a modern airplane, instead comparing only a \nV formation of birds to an airplane in the fourth paragraph.', 180),
(181, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. The previous question asks why \nUsherwood used northern bald ibises as the subject of his study. The \nanswer, that he had easy access to them because they were being \nused in another scientific study, is supported at the beginning of \nthe passage’s third paragraph: “The study, published in Nature, took \nadvantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern \nbald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.”\nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not \nsupport the answer to the previous question as to why Usherwood \nchose northern bald ibises as the subject of his study; instead, they \ndescribe the results of the study (choice A), compare birds and planes \nin flight (choice B), and describe one element of the actual study \n(choice D) but not the reason ibises were chosen.', 181),

At the end of the third paragraph the \nauthor notes that the GPS tracking devices attached to the birds \n“determined each bird’s flight position to within 30 cm.” This detail, \nalong with the author’s mention in the same sentence of another \ndevice that measured the timing of the wing flaps, provides evidence \nfor the inference that the author likely specified 30 cm to underscore \nUsherwood’s use of precise data-collection methods.\nChoice B is incorrect because the passage does not state that the \ndistance an ibis flies between wing flaps was something that could \nbe ascertained by Usherwood’s study. Choice C is incorrect because \nthe passage does not discuss the wingspan length of juvenile ibises \nor suggest that this length could be determined from Usherwood’s \ntracking data.

At the beginning of the fifth paragraph \nthe passage states that “the findings likely apply to other long-winged \nbirds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller \nbirds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too \ndifficult.” In these lines the author therefore implies that unlike smaller \nbirds, pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation likely create a \nsimilar wake to that of ibises.\nChoice A is incorrect because the passage focuses entirely on bird \nflight, not bird communication. Choices B and D are incorrect because \nthe passage discusses pelicans, storks, and geese only with respect to \ntheir drafting behavior, not in terms of their migration routes or how \nmuch energy they might expend when flying.', 183),

The seventh paragraph speculates that \nfurther research may provide insight into how and why birds fly in \nformation: “In future studies, the researchers will switch to more \ncommon birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to investigate \nhow the animals decide who sets the course and the pace.” In sum, \nthe seventh paragraph can therefore be seen as recognizing that more \nresearch is needed to explain the phenomenon of flight formation more \ncompletely.\nChoice A is incorrect because neither the seventh paragraph nor the \npassage as a whole is concerned with bird hierarchies; the decision as \nto which bird sets the “course” or “pace” is mentioned only as another \naspect of bird flight that scientists have yet to explain fully. Choice B \nis incorrect because the seventh paragraph only briefly mentions \nmistakes in V-formation flight, and this subject is not a central focus \nof the paragraph. Choice D is incorrect because although the seventh \nparagraph mentions the sighting of a lead bird or “leader” as a \npossible factor in the V formation, this factor is mentioned briefly and \nin conjunction with other factors, so that to describe it as a main idea \nwould misrepresent the paragraph as a whole.', 185),
(186, 'D', '.\nChoice D is the best answer. In describing the way that long-winged \nbirds like ibises fly in a V formation by drafting off each other, the \nseventh paragraph begins by stating, “scientists do not know how \nthe birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot.” In context, the phrase \n“aerodynamic sweet spot” characterizes the particular spatial \nrelationship among birds in the formation that affords the least \namount of wind resistance and is thus beneficial for flock members to \nmaintain.\nChoice A is incorrect because the author uses the phrase \n“aerodynamic sweet spot” in relation to bird flight, not plane flight. \nChoice B is incorrect because the phrase is not meant to imply the \njoy of flight so much as the optimum efficiency that can be found by \nflying in a certain position. Choice C is incorrect because the phrase is \nnot used to discuss synchronized wing movement among birds, nor is \nsynchronization addressed anywhere in the seventh paragraph.', 186),

In the seventh paragraph, the passage \nexplains that one aspect of bird flight that awaits further study by \nscientists is the question of whether “a mistake made by the leader can \nripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams.” In this context, \nto say that a mistake might “ripple” through the flock most nearly \nmeans that it might progressively spread through the flock.\nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of the seventh \nparagraph, to “ripple” through the flock means to spread through \nit progressively, not to fluctuate (choice A), to wave, or move in the \npattern of the ebb and flow of waves (choice C), or to undulate, or move \nin a manner that creates a textured, undulating appearance (choice D).', 187),

In the first paragraph of Passage 1, \nTocqueville predicts that “the social changes which bring nearer to the \nsame level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors \nand inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and make her more \nand more the equal of man.” In this context, to “raise” women to a \nhigher social position most nearly means to elevate, or lift, them.\nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because in the context of \nTocqueville’s prediction that women will attain a higher social position, \nthe word “raise” most nearly means elevate, not increase (choice A), \ncultivate, or support (choice B), or nurture (choice C).', 188),
(189, 'B', '.\nChoice B is the best answer. In Passage 1, Tocqueville expresses \nconcern that treating men and women as identical would likely harm \nboth genders, rather than benefit them. This sentiment can be seen \nmost clearly in the second paragraph, when he writes that “it may \nreadily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to \nthe other, both are degraded.”\nChoice A is incorrect because Tocqueville says treating men and \nwomen as identical in nature would result in the degradation of \nboth genders, a condition closer to oppression than to freedom from \noppression. Choice C is incorrect because Tocqueville does not \naddress the issue of whether men might ultimately try to reclaim any \nauthority they lost as a result of the treatment of both genders as \nidentical. Choice D is incorrect because in the passage, Tocqueville \nnever claims that treating men and women the same would result in \nsuperfluous privileges for either.', 189),
(190, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. The previous question asks what \nTocqueville implies would result from treating men and women as \nidentical in nature. The answer, that he believes such treatment would \nharm both men and women, is supported in the second paragraph of \nPassage 1: “It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to \nmake one sex equal to the other, both are degraded.”\nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support \nthe answer to the previous question about what Tocqueville implies \nwould result from treating men and women as identical; instead, they \ndiscuss European approaches to such treatment, with no reference to \nthe actual effects of it on men and women (choices A and B), and what \nTocqueville considers Americans’ proper conception of equality as it \nrelates to gender roles (choice D).', 190),
(191, 'B', '.\nChoice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 2, when \ndiscussing changing social relations, Mill writes that in her time there \nhad come to exist “a just equality, instead of the dominion of the \nstrongest.” In this context of a society where some had once wielded \nmuch greater power than others, the word “dominion” most nearly \nmeans supremacy, or greater power.\nChoices A, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of a paragraph \ndiscussing differences in the amount of power possessed by members \nof a society, “dominion” means supremacy, or greater power, not \nomnipotence, or the state of being all-powerful (choice A), ownership \n(choice C), or territory (choice D).', 191),
(192, 'B', '.\nChoice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 2, Mill \nsuggests that social roles are resistant to change in part because of \ntheir being entrenched in the cultural tradition: “for, in proportion \nto the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the \nforms and circumstances with which it has even accidentally become \nassociated.” In the context of a discussion of equality between men \nand women, Mill’s statement serves to imply that gender roles change \nso slowly precisely because they are so deeply ingrained in society and \nculture.\nChoice A is incorrect because although Mill suggests in Passage 2 that \ngender roles are deeply entrenched, she does not imply that they serve \nas the foundation of society. Choice C is incorrect because Passage 2 \ndoes not address the issue of legislative reforms, only societal ones. \nChoice D is incorrect because although Mill addresses the difficulty \nof reforming traditional gender roles, she does not attribute it to the \nbenefits that certain groups or institutions derive from those roles.', 192),
(193, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. The previous question asks about what \nMill implies is the reason it is hard to change gender roles. The \nanswer, that they are deeply entrenched in tradition, is supported \nin the first paragraph of Passage 2: “In proportion to the strength \nof a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and \ncircumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated.”\nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not \nsupport the answer to the previous question about what Mill implies \nis the reason it is hard to change gender roles, instead describing the \ncondition of general inequality in prior eras (choices A and B) and \noptimistically considering a future society that she imagines will be \nless unequal (choice D).', 193),
(194, 'A', '.\nChoice A is the best answer. Although the authors generally disagree \nabout the roles men and women should occupy, both Tocqueville and \nMill share the idea that gender equality is one small part of a societal \nshift toward equality in general. This can be seen in the first paragraph \nof Passage 1, where Tocqueville explains that raising woman to be \n“more and more the equal of man” is part of the overall “social changes \nwhich bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master \nand servant,” and in the first paragraph of Passage 2, where Mill writes \nthat “mankind have outgrown” the state of inequality and “now tend to \nsubstitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality,” \nwith gender roles being the last of these relations to undergo such a \nshift.\nChoice B is incorrect because although in Passage 1 Tocqueville \nargues that there are costs to treating men and women the same, in \nPassage 2 Mill characterizes gender equality as a source of benefits \nonly. Choice C is incorrect because neither author considers changing \ngender roles in terms of economic ramifications, focusing instead \non questions of fairness and justice and the fulfillment of people’s \npotential. Choice D is incorrect because Mill does not discuss the issue \nin terms of American democracy, though Tocqueville does.', 194),
(195, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, \nMill writes that she believes job opportunities in her society should \nbe open to all: “Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or \ndiscouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of \nthose men or women who are found by experience to be most capable \nof worthily exercising them.” In the second paragraph of Passage 1, \nTocqueville argues that equality between men and women would leave \nboth degraded; nonetheless, he recognizes that the belief in such \nequality is widespread: “There are people in Europe who . . . would \ngive to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and', 195),
(196, 'A', '.\nChoice A is the best answer. In Passage 1, Tocqueville argues that \nequality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim \nin the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women \nshould be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: \n“As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical \nand moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was \nto give a distinct employment to their various faculties.” In contrast, \nMill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and \nwomen should be awarded work based on individual ability: “Let every \noccupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and \nemployments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are \nfound by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them.” \nIt can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one’s gender should \nplay a determining factor in one’s position in society, whereas Mill \nbelieves it should not.\nChoice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill \nin Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the \nsocial class he or she was born to. Choice C is incorrect because it is \nMill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the \nproper determining factor for social position. Choice D is incorrect \nbecause although it accurately represents Tocqueville’s implicit stance \nthat an individual’s social position should contribute to society as a \nwhole, it misrepresents Mill’s argument, which conceives of social \nposition in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.', 196),
(197, 'A', '.\nChoice A is the best answer. In the third paragraph of Passage 1, \nTocqueville credits the Americans of his time for applying “to the \nsexes the great principle of political economy . . . by carefully dividing \nthe duties of man from those of woman.” In contrast, in the second \nparagraph of Passage 2, Mill argues that rigid social roles function to', 197),
(198, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. The passage’s first two paragraphs \ndescribe how “Peter Higgs and a handful of other physicists were \ntrying to understand the origin of a basic physical feature: mass,” \nand the third paragraph discusses the idea put forth (“now called \nthe Higgs field”) to explain the environment where mathematical \nequations are most helpful in understanding mass. The passage shifts \nits focus, however: the fourth and fifth paragraphs describe how the \nidea of the Higgs field was not initially well-received in the scientific \ncommunity, and the last paragraph illustrates that in modern times, the \nidea ultimately became an accepted fact to most scientists. Over the \ncourse of the passage, then, it can be seen that the main focus of \nthe passage changes from an explanation of what the Higgs field is to \nan explanation of how the theory of it was received.\nChoice A is incorrect because the passage makes no shift from a more \nto a less technical mode of description, and indeed the entire passage \nis aimed at readers with no specialized knowledge of physics. Choice B \nis incorrect because the passage never provides any contextualization \nof Higgs’s work within other lines of inquiry in physics contemporary \nto Higgs. Choice D is incorrect because the passage offers no \nspeculation regarding future discoveries that may result from the \nconfirmation of the Higgs field’s existence.', 198),
(199, 'D', '.\nChoice D is the best answer. The third paragraph of the passage \nprovides the following analogy: “For a mental toehold, think of a \nping-pong ball submerged in water.” Since this analogy occurs in a \ndiscussion of how mass operates within the Higgs field, it functions to \nexplain an abstract concept in terms more readily grasped by readers \nwith no background in physics.', 199),
(200, 'D', '.\nChoice D is the best answer. The fourth paragraph of the passage \nexplains why Higgs’s idea of the Higgs field was initially rebuffed by \nthe scientific community: “The paper was rejected. Not because it \ncontained a technical error, but because the premise of an invisible \nsomething permeating space, interacting with particles to provide their \nmass, well, it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought speculation.” \nIn other words, the scientific community was skeptical of Higgs’s \nidea because it appeared to be mere theoretical speculation, with no \nempirical evidence to support it.\nChoice A is incorrect because the passage makes clear that Higgs’s \nidea addressed a theoretical problem already recognized by scientists, \nrather than a problem yet to be noticed by them. Choice B is incorrect \nbecause the fourth paragraph implies that Higgs’s paper was rigorous \n(free from “technical error”), rather than problematic at the level of its \nequations. Choice C is incorrect because the passage never indicates \nthat the acceptance of the Higgs field had the effect of rendering other, \nearlier theories in physics obsolete.', 200),
(201, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. The previous question asks why the \nscientific community initially rejected the idea of the Higgs field. \nThe answer, that Higgs offered only theoretical speculation for the \nexistence of the field, not actual evidence, is supported in the fourth \nparagraph: “The paper was rejected. Not because it contained a \ntechnical error, but because the premise of an invisible something \npermeating space, interacting with particles to provide their mass, \nwell, it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought speculation.”\nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not \nsupport the answer to the previous question about why the scientific \ncommunity initially rejected the idea of the Higgs field, instead \ndiscussing how Higgs dealt with established equations in physics \nwhen he theorized the field (choice A), describing the circumstances in \nwhich Higgs revealed his theory to the scientific community (choice B), \nand illustrating the fact that the Higgs field eventually came to be an \naccepted fact to most scientists (choice D).', 201),
(202, 'A', '.\nChoice A is the best answer. The fifth paragraph of the passage \nexplains how the idea of the Higgs field eventually came to be accepted \nin the scientific community: “But Higgs persevered (and his revised \npaper appeared later that year in another journal), and physicists who \ntook the time to study the proposal gradually realized that his idea \nwas a stroke of genius, one that allowed them to have their cake and \neat it too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations can retain \ntheir pristine form because the dirty work of providing the particles’ \nmasses is relegated to the environment.” In saying that the Higgs field \ncame to be accepted because it allowed scientists to “have their cake \nand eat it too,” the author suggests that Higgs’s theory was ultimately \naccepted as fact in part because it allowed physicists to reconcile \nwhat had seemed to be contradictory conditions: the harmony of the \nmathematical equations and the particles’ apparent mass.\nChoice B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that \nthe Higgs field was necessarily a concept that could be applied to \nother problems in physics than those immediately under Higgs’s \nconsideration. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not \nsuggest that Higgs’s theory was accepted because it provided an \nanswer to a question that earlier scientists had failed to anticipate. \nChoice D is incorrect because the passage never addresses any two \nphenomena being misinterpreted as a single phenomenon.', 202),
(203, 'C', '.\nChoice C is the best answer. The previous question asks for one \nreason Higgs’s theory eventually gained acceptance in the scientific \ncommunity. The answer, that it reconciled two seemingly irreconcilable \nconditions, is supported in the passage’s fifth paragraph: “But Higgs \npersevered (and his revised paper appeared later that year in another \njournal), and physicists who took the time to study the proposal \ngradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius, one that \nallowed them to have their cake and eat it too. In Higgs’s scheme, \nthe fundamental equations can retain their pristine form because \nthe dirty work of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the \nenvironment.” These lines make clear that Higgs’s theory allowed for \nthe particles’ mass, while at the same time accepting the fundamental \nequations as valid.\nChoices A, B, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not \nsupport the answer to the previous question about why the Higgs field \neventually gained acceptance in the scientific community, instead \nexplaining certain aspects of the Higgs field (choices A and B) and \ndiscussing how certain scientific theories become accepted as fact \neven before they are proven (choice D).', 203),
(204, 'A', '.\nChoice A is the best answer. The main point of the last paragraph \ncan be seen in its final sentence, which states that “mathematical \nequations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale, they can \nseemingly radiate reality so strongly, that they become entrenched \nin the vernacular of working physicists, even before there’s data to \nconfirm them.” This point is borne out by the preceding lines of the \nparagraph, which recount the author’s own experience of studying the \nstill unproven Higgs field as it if were already a settled fact.\nChoice B is incorrect because the anecdote the author shares about \nhis own education does not demonstrate that physics, as a discipline, \nhas come to operate differently over the course of his career. Choice \nC is incorrect because the details of the author’s experience do not \npoint to the process by which the existence of the Higgs field was \nconfirmed, and indeed the passage does not describe that process at \nall. Choice D is incorrect because the passage broadly discusses the \nstatus of Higgs’s theory at two different times (its initial rejection and \nlater acceptance by physicists) and never considers how the details of \nthe theory may have evolved.', 204),
(205, 'A', '.\nChoice A is the best answer. In the last paragraph, the author states \nthat “the professor presented the Higgs field with such certainty \nthat for a long while I had no idea it had yet to be established \nexperimentally.” In this context, for a scientific theory to be established \nmost nearly means that it is validated, or proven.\nChoices B, C, and D are incorrect because in the context of the \nlast paragraph describing a scientific theory as being “established \nexperimentally,” the word “established” means validated, or proven, \nnot founded (choice B), introduced (choice C), or enacted (choice D).', 205),

The graph shows the periods of time that \ntranspired between the moment when certain scientific concepts were \nintroduced and the moment when those concepts were scientifically \nproven. Given the passage’s discussion of the Higgs field, which \nwas initially rejected by the scientific community before ultimately \nbeing accepted by it, the graph can therefore be seen as a means to \nput Higgs’s work on mass into a greater context with other radical \nconcepts that were ultimately accepted by the scientific community.\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph illustrates that the Higgs \nboson required significantly more time to be confirmed than did any of \nthe other theorized particles.

(208, 'D', '.\nChoice D is the best answer. In the last paragraph of the passage, the \nauthor explains that by the mid-1980s, “the physics community had, \nfor the most part, fully bought into the idea that there was a Higgs \nfield permeating space.” That was fifteen years after the concept was \nintroduced but decades before it would be confirmed, which would be \nanalogous to most physicists believing in the existence of the electron \nneutrino in 1940, well after it had been introduced but many years \nbefore it was confirmed via experiment.\nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because the author depicts the \nHiggs field in the mid-1980s as being virtually an accepted fact, even \nthough it had not yet been proven experimentally. This situation is \nnot analogous to a proposed particle that is widely disputed until it is \nconfirmed experimentally (choice A), a particle that has already been \nconfirmed and consequently elicits widespread acceptance (choice B), \nor particles that are not considered as possibilities before the date on \nwhich they are formally proposed (choice C).', 208),

Where my school friends saw notches of ink on \nincomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people.” The fourth \nparagraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as \na “sanctuary” and “refuge.” The shift in focus occurs in the last six \nparagraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the \nnarrator’s love of reading into a desire to write: “I did not think there \ncould be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning \nto suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was \nconvinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in life but learn to do \nwhat Mr. Dickens had done.” Thus the passage’s overall focus shifts \nfrom the narrator’s love of reading to a specific incident that influences \nhis decision to become a writer.\nChoice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the \nnarrator’s father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator’s \ndetermination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice C is incorrect \nbecause the passage focuses on the narrator’s desire to write rather \nthan on whatever skill he may have as a writer.

The first paragraph of the passage \nmakes clear that salt exhibits elasticity (“stretching like taffy”) in the \nnanoworld, and the eighth paragraph explains that salt possesses some \ndegree of elasticity in the macroworld as well: “Huge underground \ndeposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is believed to play \na role at these scales.” Thus flexibility describes the relationship \nbetween salt’s behavior in both the nanoworld and the macroworld.\nChoice B is incorrect because the third paragraph explains that \n“scientists don’t expect” salt’s flexibility in the nanoworld, not that \nthey do expect it; moreover, there is no indication that salt’s flexibility \nin the macroworld is surprising. Choice C is incorrect because the \npassage doesn’t make clear whether nanowires were first observed \nin the nanoworld or the macroworld.

The bottom graph illustrates the process \ndescribed in the first sentence of the seventh paragraph of the passage: \n“as the microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt stretches.” On the \ngraph, the stretching of the salt is represented by the amount of force, \nin micronewtons, exerted on the microscope tip as the tip moves away \nfrom the salt surface. The graph shows that force was exerted on the \ntip until the tip reached point T at approximately 22 nanometers from \nthe salt surface; from point T on, the force was 0 micronewtons. It can \nbe inferred that since no force is being exerted after point T, point T is \nthe point at which a salt nanowire breaks.\nChoices A, B, and C are incorrect because the labels P, Q, and R all \nappear on the top graph, which represents data on the movement of \nthe microscope tip toward the salt surface. As the fifth sentence of the \nfifth paragraph explains, when the microscope tip moved toward the \nsalt, “the salt actually stretched out to glom on to the microscope \ntip.” Therefore, the first graph shows the salt attaching itself to the \nmicroscope tip and forming nanowires, not the breaking of a nanowire.', 239),

In the first paragraph of Passage 1, \nDouglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be “a house \ndivided against itself,” due to its provisions for the division of the \nnation into slave states and free states, and to be “in violation of the \nlaw of God.” In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of \nhis position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that \nit isn’t the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for \nslavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it \nisn’t currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension \nbetween the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas’s \ncriticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on \nthe other, Lincoln’s insistence that Douglas has misrepresented \nhis position.\nChoice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) proposes no \nchanges to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) \ndoesn’t consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy \npopular support.

Choice B is \nincorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs \nto conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trap-\nclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant’s calcium \nreserves themselves require conservation. Choice D is incorrect \nbecause it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of \nmultiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on \nthe improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper \nprey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, \nthe Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.', 251),

(260, 'C', 'Choice C is the best answer. The second sentence of the last \nparagraph says that the focus of Volkov’s work was the role of \nelectricity in the Venus flytrap’s closing mechanism. The paragraph \ngoes on to explain that by applying electricity directly to the plant \nand “altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine \nthe exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.” It is therefore \naccurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive \nuse of information obtained from measuring the plant’s response to \nvarying amounts of electrical current.\nChoice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains \nthat Volkov’s work was based on Hodick and Sievers’s mathematical \nmodel in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus \nflytrap, that model isn’t described as predicting the precise amount of \ncharge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier \nmodel, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use \nof the findings generated by his experiment. Choice B is incorrect \nbecause the passage doesn’t describe Volkov’s work as having \ninvolved analysis of data from earlier studies on the plant’s response to \nelectricity. Choice D is incorrect because although the last paragraph \nexplains that Volkov based his work on Hodick and Sievers’s earlier \nmodel, this was the sole model that Volkov relied on, and there is \nno suggestion that he made use of multiple “published theories” \nor “earlier models”; moreover, he made more extensive use of data \ngenerated by his own experiment than of Hodick and Sievers’s model.', 260);
