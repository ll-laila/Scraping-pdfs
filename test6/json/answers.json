The remainder of the paragraph focuses on the way Nawab attempts to \n\u201cproliferate\u201d those income sources by identifying some of the moneymaking schemes Nawab \nundertakes, including setting up a flour mill and a fish farm and attempting to fix both radios and \nwatches.  \nChoice A is incorrect because even if the first paragraph does indicate that Nawab is willing to work hard \nto take care of his family, it does not specifically address how he interacts with his daughters \nemotionally. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph describes some of Nawab\u2019s activities but \nnot the specifics of his schedule. Choice D is incorrect because the first paragraph introduces Harouni as \nNawab\u2019s employer but does not describe his lifestyle.",
