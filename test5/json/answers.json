The second paragraph reveals what Lymie is reading about (the Peace of Paris and the Congress of \nVienna) and suggests his intense concentration on the book (\u201csometimes he swallowed whole the food \nthat he had no idea he was eating,\u201d lines 23-24). In the third paragraph, the focus of the passage shifts \nto a description and discussion of others in the restaurant, namely \u201cA party of four, two men and two \nwomen . . . \u201d (lines 42-43). \nChoice A is incorrect because the passage does not provide observations made by other characters, only \noffering Lymie\u2019s and the narrator\u2019s observations.
